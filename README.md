### Autonomous_Car
##### A Basic flowchart for the understanding of the project is also included in NeuralNetworkModel Folder
This project builds a Autonomous_Car using Open CV Neural_Network,Raspberrypie,Arduino and Open Source Software.
Raspberrypie collects data from ultrasonic module and camera module and sends data to computer through a wireless network.
The computer processes input images and sensor data for object detection (stop sign and traffic light) and collision avoidance respectively. 
A neural network model runs on computer and makes predictions for steering based on input images.
Predictions are then sent to the Arduino for RC car control.
